# Website Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored your Astro personal academic portfolio with a new navigation structure and content organization system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Updates (`src/settings.ts`)
- Added `NAV_LINKS` array with 8 main navigation items:
  - Home (/)
  - Research (/research)
  - Publications (/publications)
  - Teaching & Coursework (/teaching)
  - Skills (/skills)
  - Series (/series)
  - CV (/cv)
  - Contact (/contact)

### 2. Updated Components
- **Navbar** (`src/components/ui/Navbar.astro`): Now dynamically renders navigation from `NAV_LINKS` array

### 3. Content Collections (`src/content.config.ts`)
Added 4 new collections with Zod schemas:
- **papers**: Research papers with authors, venue, year, DOI, PDF, keywords
- **patents**: Patent information with inventors, number, status, link
- **teaching**: Teaching experience with role, course, term, institution
- **series**: Blog series posts with title, date, tags, summary

### 4. Sample Content Files Created
- `src/content/papers/example-paper-1.md`
- `src/content/patents/example-patent-1.md`
- `src/content/teaching/example-teaching-1.md`
- `src/content/series/2025-10-01-hello-series.md`
