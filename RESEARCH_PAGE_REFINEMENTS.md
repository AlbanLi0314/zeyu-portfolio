# Research Page Refinements

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. **Heading Style Consistency** ✅
- **Before:** `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold mb-4 text-primary`
- **After:** `text-4xl font-bold mb-8`
- **Result:** Now matches the Publications and Teaching pages exactly
- Removed the md:text-5xl responsive sizing and primary color
- Changed margin from mb-4 to mb-8 for consistency

### 2. **Removed Duplicate Topic Badges** ✅
- **Deleted:** The research topic badges section (DNA tracers, DNA hydrogels, etc.)
- **Reason:** These topics are already displayed in the sticky navigation bar below
- **Impact:** Cleaner hero section, no redundancy

### 3. **Improved Metrics Clarity** ✅
- **Before:**
  - `91% Cost Reduction` (unclear what this refers to)
  - `11 km² Field Scale` (unclear what this measures)
  - Different colors for each metric (primary, secondary, accent, info)

- **After:**
  - `91% cost reduction (DNA extraction)` - Clear context
  - `11 km² field deployment (eDNA tracers)` - Clear context
  - **All numbers now use primary color** for consistency

### 4. **Removed Redundant Impact Section** ✅
- **Deleted:** The entire "Research Impact" section at the bottom
- **Reason:** Metrics are already displayed at the top of the page
- **Impact:** Eliminates duplication, cleaner page structure

## Visual Improvements

### Before:
```
Research (large, colored title)
├── Subtitle
├── Topic badges (DNA tracers, DNA hydrogels, etc.) ❌ Duplicate
├── Metrics (mixed colors) ❌ Inconsistent
├── Sticky Nav
├── Projects...
└── Research Impact Section ❌ Redundant
    └── Stats cards (3 publications, 2 patents, 91%)
```

### After:
```
Research (standard title matching other pages) ✅
├── Subtitle
├── Metrics (all primary color, with context) ✅
├── Sticky Nav
├── Projects...
└── Back to Top Button
```

## Style Consistency Achieved

| Element | Publications | Teaching | Research (Now) | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| H1 Size | text-4xl | text-4xl | text-4xl | ✅ Match |
| H1 Weight | font-bold | font-bold | font-bold | ✅ Match |
| H1 Margin | mb-8 | mb-8 | mb-8 | ✅ Match |
| H1 Color | Default | Default | Default | ✅ Match |

## Benefits

1. **Visual Consistency:** Research page now matches the design language of other pages
2. **Better Clarity:** Metrics include context (what was reduced, what was deployed)
3. **No Redundancy:** Removed duplicate topic badges and impact section
4. **Unified Color Scheme:** All metric numbers use primary color for consistency
5. **Cleaner Layout:** Simpler, more focused page structure
