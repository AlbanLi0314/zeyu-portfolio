		<div class='prose max-w-none'>
			<p class='text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4'>
				I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biological & Environmental Engineering at Cornell University, 
				developing DNA-polymer nanoparticle tracers for large-scale hydrological monitoring and 
				DNA-composite hydrogels for self-healing and stimulus-responsive structural materials.
			</p>
			<p class='text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4'>
				My research led a 7-member, four-discipline collaboration that field-deployed tracers across 
				an 11 kmÂ² lake, achieving robust detection 7 km from release with only 1 mg DNA. This work 
				generated data calibrating 3D hydrodynamic eDNA-transport models. I have also developed 
				programmable, 3D-printable DNA hydrogels with autonomous self-healing capabilities and 
				an automated DNA-purification platform that reduced costs by 91%.
			</p>
			<p class='text-lg leading-relaxed'>
				Core strengths include nanoparticle fabrication, additive manufacturing, polymer and biomaterials 
				engineering, and advanced materials characterization. I am co-author of peer-reviewed publications 
				in high-impact journals and co-inventor on a U.S. patent.
