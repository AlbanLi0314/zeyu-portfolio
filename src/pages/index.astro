				**Graduating May 2026. Available for full-time roles starting May/June 2026.**
			</p>
			<p class='text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content'>
				I am a PhD candidate in Biological and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University **(**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University), advised by Prof. Dan Luo (https://cals.cornell.edu/people/dan-luo)**.**
			</p>
			<p class='text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content'>
				I design and fabricate **DNA-based materials** and apply **molecular biology methods** to solve problems across domains including **environmental science**, **architecture**, **soft-matter/polymer materials**, and **synthetic biology**.
			</p>
			<p class='text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content'>
				I engineer **synthetic DNA-polymer micro-particles** for high-resolution measurement in large aquatic systems. Built as an end-to-end workflow across particle engineering, qPCR quantification, and 3D Lagrangian transport modeling, the approach was validated in an **11 km²** lake-scale field deployment with robust detection up to 7 km from release using only **1 mg** of DNA, and the resulting data calibrate 3D hydrodynamic transport models.
			</p>
			<p class='text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content'>
				I develop **biomass-derived DNA hydrogels and composites** as programmable, self-healing soft materials designed for practical fabrication. The work spans design, fabrication, and materials testing, and has been demonstrated through damage-repair cycles, including a project published at ACADIA 2024 as one demonstration of the approach. I also developed a **low-cost DNA extraction method** that reduces material costs by approximately **91%**, enabling scalable production and integration into processes such as 3D printing and composite manufacturing.
			</p>
			<p class='text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content'>
				I hold **M.S.** and **M.Eng.** degrees from Cornell University and completed my undergraduate studies at Hong Kong Baptist University (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Baptist_University), earning a **B.Sc. in Chemistry** with a **Computer Science minor**. working in Microfabrication & Surface Materials Lab supervised by Prof. Kangning Ren. (https://chem.hkbu.edu.hk/ren) Beyond publications and conference presentations, I also hold U.S. and China patents in structural design and materials manufacturing.
