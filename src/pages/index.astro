				<strong>Graduating May 2026. Available for full-time roles starting May/June 2026.</strong>
			</p>
			<p class='text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content'>
				I am a PhD candidate in Biological and Environmental Engineering at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University">Cornell University</a>, advised by <a href="https://cals.cornell.edu/people/dan-luo">Prof. Dan Luo</a>.
			</p>
			<p class='text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content'>
				I design and fabricate <strong>DNA-based materials</strong> and apply <strong>molecular biology methods</strong> to solve problems across domains including <strong>environmental science</strong>, <strong>architecture</strong>, <strong>soft-matter/polymer materials</strong>, and <strong>synthetic biology</strong>.
			</p>
			<p class='text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content'>
				I engineer <strong>synthetic DNA-polymer micro-particles</strong> for high-resolution measurement in large aquatic systems. Built as an end-to-end workflow across particle engineering, qPCR quantification, and 3D Lagrangian transport modeling, the approach was validated in an <strong>11 km²</strong> lake-scale field deployment with robust detection up to 7 km from release using only <strong>1 mg</strong> of DNA, and the resulting data calibrate 3D hydrodynamic transport models.
			</p>
			<p class='text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content'>
				I develop <strong>biomass-derived DNA hydrogels and composites</strong> as programmable, self-healing soft materials designed for practical fabrication. The work spans design, fabrication, and materials testing, and has been demonstrated through damage-repair cycles, including a project published at ACADIA 2024 as one demonstration of the approach. I also developed a <strong>low-cost DNA extraction method</strong> that reduces material costs by approximately <strong>91%</strong>, enabling scalable production and integration into processes such as 3D printing and composite manufacturing.
			</p>
			<p class='text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content'>
				I hold <strong>M.S.</strong> and <strong>M.Eng.</strong> degrees from Cornell University and completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Baptist_University">Hong Kong Baptist University</a>, earning a <strong>B.Sc. in Chemistry</strong> with a <strong>Computer Science minor</strong>. working in <a href="https://chem.hkbu.edu.hk/ren">Microfabrication & Surface Materials Lab</a> supervised by <a href="https://chem.hkbu.edu.hk/ren">Prof. Kangning Ren</a>. Beyond publications and conference presentations, I also hold U.S. and China patents in structural design and materials manufacturing.
