# Abstract

Engineered nanopatterned Teflon films achieving ultra-low wettability and high mechanical durability through hierarchical surface architectures.

## Technical Approach

- Fabricated using photolithography and two-photon lithography
- Chemical etching for precise nanopatterning
- Achieved optimal topology-specific superwettability
- Demonstrated ultradurability under mechanical stress

## Impact
