# Abstract

A continuous-flow biomanufacturing platform utilizing replaceable cartridge modules that overcomes the intrinsic limits of cell-based and cell-free biochemical reactions by maintaining cell-free reactions in a non-equilibrium steady state. DNA templates are covalently immobilized into a polyethylene glycol hydrogel within a porous mesh, enabling stable, continuous multi-day synthesis of diverse RNA products including mRNAs, structural RNAs, and short regulatory RNAs. An extended 100-day production of fluorescent reporter mRNA demonstrates months-long production capacity with a linear increase in cumulative yield.

## Key Achievements

- Demonstrated perpetual (100+ day) nucleic acid production via continuous-flow chip reactor
- Decoupled template lifetime from reaction lifetime, preventing saturation
- Constructed a three-state FET-like RNA logic gate with fluorescence readout for on-chip information processing
- Hardware architecture inherently suited to AI-augmented process control
