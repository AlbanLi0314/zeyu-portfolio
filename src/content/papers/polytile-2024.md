# Abstract

Developed DNA–Al³⁺ hydrogels and integrated them into CAD-designed, 3D-printed vascular tiles in collaboration with an architecture research team.

## Key Contributions

- Restored crack integrity through multiple damage–heal cycles
- Verified performance through tensile testing of healed specimens
- Used EDS to confirm elemental distribution
- Demonstrated autonomous repair potential for infrastructure materials

## Publication

Published in ACADIA 2024 proceedings.
