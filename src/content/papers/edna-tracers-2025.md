# Abstract

Developed and field-deployed DNA-polymer nanoparticle tracers across an 11 km² sector of Cayuga Lake. Coordinated interdisciplinary team spanning hydrology, ecology, environmental science, and materials engineering.

## Key Achievements

- Achieved robust qPCR detection 7 km from release point using only 1 mg of DNA
- Generated calibration data for 3D hydrodynamic eDNA-transport models
- Demonstrated viability of synthetic tracers for large-scale aquatic ecosystem monitoring

## Status

Manuscript under review (2025)
