      I don't treat AI like a reliable calculator or a colleague who "gets" what I mean. I treat it like a fast executor that's great at generating drafts, code, and alternatives — but still needs clear structure and careful checking. The work starts with me: I decide what question matters, break it into smaller steps, and define what a good answer should look like. Then I let the model run: write the first pass, explore options, refactor code, and surface patterns. Finally, I verify everything against the domain reality — controls, assumptions, edge cases — and only keep what holds up.
